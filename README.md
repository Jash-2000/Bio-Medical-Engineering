# Bio-Medical-Engineering

This repository contains the **final course report** and **other non-course assignments** I did for understanding the concepts of BITS Pilani Undergraduate course - EEE F432 ( Medical Instrumentation ), currently ongoing, under supervision of [Dr. Sujan Yenuganti](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/yenugantisujan/Profile).

1 of my reports has recieved funding under course instructor and would be later considered for a publication ( after experimentions are done once the campus re-opens) and the 2nd one is under review.

The description of all the projects is present below, but the reporistory is not maintained properly and I will keep on updating the repository.
